Created using Visual Studio 2010 in conjuction with IntelOpenCL SDK

This project is currently a basic, fairly optimized OpenCl implementation
of a fully connected feed forward network. In addition, this project has a 
partially implemented Convolutional Neural Network.

Includes ability to store and load neural nets from files

MNIST Data set:
    One fully connected neural net of size 150-200-100-10 achieved an error rate of 3.23%
    Another one of size 800-500-250-10 has achieved an error rate of 2.3%
